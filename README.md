##    Requirements
The overall requirements for this homework are as follows: -
*    “In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-     biodiversity/), 
*    which catalogs the microbes that colonise human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, 
*    or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.”

##    Tackling the Assignment 
The Assignment was conducted in two parts. 
Each part has been deployed separately to Github pages at the following links: 
1.	Plotly		https://mikemurf.github.io/15-Plotly-Step-1-Homework/ 
2.	Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional) 
			https://mikemurf.github.io/15-Plotly-Advanced-Challenge-Homework/ 

##    Step 1: Plotly - this was the minimum requirement for the assignment to: -
1.	Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.
2.	Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3.	Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4.	Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
5.	Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
6.	Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

The Output from Step 1: Plotly is as follows: 
Test Subject ID No.: 940 - Top Half – Screen 1 
Test Subject ID No.: 940 - Bottom Half – Screen 2
  Test Subject ID No.: 

Test Subject ID No.: 955 - Top Half – Screen 1	
 			

Test Subject ID No.: 955 - Bottom Half – Screen 2
 










Step 2: Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional) requirement was to: -
1.	Adapt the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
2.	You need to modify the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9.
3.	Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.

The Output from Step 2: Advanced Challenge is as follows: 
Test Subject ID No.: 940 - Top Half – Screen 1
 

Test Subject ID No.: 940 - Bottom Half – Screen 2 			

Test Subject ID No.: 955 - Top Half – Screen 1
 

Test Subject ID No.: 955 - Bottom Half – Screen 2
